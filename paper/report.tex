\begin{abstract}
  It is often the case that initial query compositions result in frequent restarts as
  the user negotiates with their retrieval system. This is likely a product of unfortunate
  query formulations or choice of ranking algorithm. Our proposed retrieval system
  encourages diversity in displayed documents by introducing an unsupervised clustering
  step before displaying results. The clusters are then presented to the user with their
  documents ranked independent of each group. We do this by clearly separating the
  retrieval process into the three steps \texttt{relevance}, \texttt{clustering}, and
  \texttt{ranking}, then allow the user to recurse this process on a cluster (rather
  than restarting their query). Additionally, we propose a simple method to
  compare results against varying quality \tfidf queries. Our final product is a demo
  harness that abstracts these steps, so that others may easily produce and reproduce
  prototypes against their own corpora.

\section{Introduction}
Information retrieval systems have long suffered from non-informative query formulations
by their users. Many systems employ techniques such as query expansion, domain ontologies,
advanced search parameters, to address such difficulties. Unfortunately, most retrieval
systems presume user provided queries to be informative, and select to return the most
query-relevant documents. We can interpret a query-relevance ranking on documents retrieved
by a non-informative query as being an over-fit ranking (to the query). Unfortunately, this
over-fitting can happen regardless of query quality. In cases where all documents retrieved
are nearly identical.

Either in the case of non-informative queries or of monolithic document listings, users
are often tasked with query reformulation. Reformulation may be an insufficient mechanism,
for users not appropriately familiar with their target domain. Additionally, as
a side effect of this workflow, query reformulation can make it difficult to assess
the general effectiveness of a retrieval system\cite{Huang2009}.

To prevent over-fit rankings some retrieval systems have proposed document diversification
strategies\cite{Zhu2014}. This can be accomplished by introducing similarity or
taxonomic clustering of documents either prior to or after query submission. Additionally,
to improve query formulation many search engines provide similar search terms along side
retrieved documents. These aid terms are usually assigned by experts
to similar vocabulary or to retrieved documents, and can be expensive to curate.

\subsection{Proposal}
We propose to develop a harness for prototyping information retrieval systems against
corpora where clustering and ranking do not inform eachother.
In our system, we propose separating the query processing pipeline into quarantined
steps. We first identify documents by relevance, then perform unsupervised clustering
of relevant documents, finally rank each cluster by the query provided. We then allow
the user to zoom in on a cluster. During this process, every cluster is also tagged with
terms automatically, by providing the grouping's most impactful \tfidf words. These terms
don't impact the ranking, but act to provide the user with additional information in
selecting a term.

We hypothesis that a document clustering will allow users to eliminate poor document
groupings. Additionally automatic tagging of clusters with relevance terms should allow
users to navigate a listing retrieved from non-informative queries. To form queries, we
sample words from randomly selected documents' $\tfidf$ distributions and capture the
resulting ranking $R_\tfidf$. For a system with $C$-way clustering to be considered
permanent, the same query should yield our target document within $S$ steps.

\[S < log_C (R_\tfidf)\]

As this is a process greatly empowered by composable components, we also separate out
these concerns in code, to hopefully decrease testing time against multiple corpora,
ranking, and clustering configurations.

%\section{Related Work}

\section{Implementation Details}
We provide a retrieval systems harness, developed in \python\footnote{\site}. The
harness is designed to be used from the command line, but hosts results in a manner
accessible to a flask server (that is also provided).

In order to reduce complexity\footnote{and scratch the author's wish to use array languages},
\np arrays were used to track, sort, and split document collections. Interfaces that
required of designers must yield index arrays. Unfortunately, (presently) this limits
corpus scaling to what can be handled by \np. As an additional restriction, corpora are
required to be transformed to \np compliant structures.\footnote{examples found in code}

Provided is the \texttt{olib.Handler} class that orchestrates the cluster, ranking,
steps as a coroutines. An \texttt{olib.Organizer} is passed as a constructor to the
\texttt{olib.Hanlder}.
\texttt{olib.Organizers} which are \np.\texttt{ndarray}s extended with interfaces for
\texttt{.cluster(vocabulary, n\_clusters)} and \texttt{.rank(*rankargs)}, which raise
\texttt{NotImplemented} unless provided by designer. Designers implement their own
\texttt{olib.Organizer}s and overload these methods.

For our test cases, we have \texttt{kmidf.CosKMIDFROrganizer} which is a \tfidf
ranker coupled with k-means over cosine distance, and \texttt{ldaidf.LDAIDFOrganizer}
which is a \tfidf ranker coupled with Latent Dirichlet Allocation max clustering.
Classes pretended with \texttt{Augmented} have been altered for evaluation purposes.

Modifications to a handler allow us an oracle into the performance of a system.
\texttt{olib.AugmentedHandler} tags a cluster's meta-data with ownership of a target
document, and it's rank location. This allows us to use traverse a guided path
through our documents. We still require that discovery of a document is measured by
it's being placed in the displayed range (top 3 by default) for a cluster.

\section{Evaluation}
\subsection{Approach}
In order to provide repeatable results without depending on expertly relevance
and ranked corpora, we base our comparisons against traditional \tfidf. Relevance
is determined as any document containing any of the query terms, and it's rank is
defined as $R_\tfidf$ denoting its place in the listing, from \tfidf score
against these documents. As mentioned above, for a system with $C$-way clustering
to be considered proffered, an identical query should yield our target document
within $S$ steps.

In this case, the clusters contain unique document lists\footnote{It is not a
  restriction of the system that clusters need be unique}. This means that success
is measured by satisfying bounds for \(S < log_C\left(R_\tfidf\right)\).
Using the augmented structures, described above, clusters are labeled to contain
the target document. This however would not be the case in a real environment.
It is also important to note that some documents contained the only instance of
a word in the corpus. To prevent sampling these words, we eliminated words with
\tfidf scores $\geq 1$ from our sample space.

We generated tests against two different systems, the \texttt{kmidf.CosKMIDFROrganizer}
and the \texttt{kmidf.LDAIDFROrganizer}, with a collection of tenthousand medical
abstracts.

The unit retrieval was a structure of cluster labels and corresponding document labels with
meta-data. The image below is an example of a first response on \texttt{kmidf.CosKMIDFROrganizer}.

\subsection{Results and Discovered Limitations}
After selecting many documents, from the corpus, at varying query strengths we were
rarely able to satisfy the success criteria. This may have been due to many factors,
some of which arose as a serious consequence of pure segregation of clustering from
ranking. Ranking that isn't informed by clustering would retain the same top documents,
unless you were (randomly) lucky enough split along the top ranked documents. This
behavior resulted in stagnating documents at the top of reported clusters, suppressing
the target document from being selected.

This document suppression was especially bad in k-means. This was likely because the
the scoring metric for document similarity was in the same space as the ranking.
Consequently, if a target document was close to a dense centroid, then it would likely
never hit the visible documents list; as its competing documents would likely
continue to score high from that region. This was a poor outcome.

Additionally, the soft clustering (found in Latent Dirichlet Allocation) introduced
problems with reasonable group assignment. As groups became smaller, topics became
less informative and would often break down. Complicated group assignment algorithms
(informed by LDA) were used, but resulted in meaningless splits nearing the end
of a query session.

The most tested document,
\texttt{id(9871)}\footnote{Molecular Aging of the Human Brain: Genetic Modulation and Functional Outcomes},
was selected due to the evaluator's ability to understand it's content. The hope
was to use a cluster's meta-data, in the form of cluster informed keywords, to guide
sub cluster selection. Unfortunately, due to document suppression, dense documents
clusters what overlapped with the query results also overloaded the meta search terms.
Finally, \tfidf distributions weren't updated between clustering steps, which resulted
in stabilization of terms in groups, (eventually leading to many shared terms across
groups). The evaluator was unable to appraise cluster selection without the oracle by
use the assisted query terms; likely due to the costs of document suppression. Similar
results were found with other documents.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Interestingly, since both k-means over cos-distance and LDA provided very stable results
on this corpus. It has become apparent, that stable clustering may significantly reduce the
effects that ranking may have when selecting a cluster to recurse on. Further work may lead
to better strategies for perturbing these clusters, so that ranking can have more
interesting effects.

\subsection{Limitations}
In order to support more sophisticated document clustering and ranking (like those using
word2vec) we will need to loosen our restriction to \np data structures. Additionally,
significant speedups could be found in the document relevance lookup, resulting in faster
testing of configurations to corpora.

Although this was proposed as an evaluation harness, several design decisions weren't made
with evaluation in mind. The \texttt{AugmentedHandler} behavior should be moved to first
priority in the class structure, as to provide sane defaults for potential users of the
system.

\section{Next Steps}
Firstly, we would like to address any concerns raised from the limitations section. We
are also interested in providing a full restful API so those who find these systems useful
may easily host their corpora without much engineering effort.

We are also interested in extending user search to include selecting multiple clusters and
inject new query terms without restarting their search.

\section{Conclusions}
This project will likely die in its current encarnation. The results weren't very promising,
and the discovered fixes violate the original premis. We are still interested in starting
clean with a retrieval system prototyping harness, but likely starting fresh with our newly
gained knowlege.
